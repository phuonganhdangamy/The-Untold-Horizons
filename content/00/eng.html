                        Hello everyone~! Welcome to The Untold Horizons, a blog sharing our moments in life, especially in learning and refining ourselves. We are ‘yma’ and ‘panda’, nice to meet you guys!
                <img src="../../images/post/post-00.png" alt="" class="post-image">      
                        Befriended in the second semester of grade 10 in Tran Dai Nghia High School for the Gifted (what a cool name and a cool school!) in HCMC, we were very different in our previous education experiences and perspectives; one was always trying hard, while the other was not so much… But whatever it was, the universe put us in the same group of close friends who always strive to learn and grow, and here comes our lasting friendship that drastically changed our mindset. After graduating from high school last year, although our pathways were nowhere in common: one has immediately dived into university life abroad, while the other has taken a gap year to hone their different skills, we still share the same vision, as we both believe in the power of education. We know it is never too late to begin anything, and we always try our best toward our goals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Together we can change the world. We are confident that our two’s and hopefully, our other supportive friends’ perspectives and experiences in different learning environments, study methods, goals, career paths, etc. will have more empathy than enough for you, as well as a broad view about our worries when facing adulthood. As the name "The Untold Horizons" suggests, we hope to become a valuable support for you, with stories and lessons drawn from personal experiences, especially learning experiences. From these, you can refer to and distill the right and suitable formulas for yourself, making your journey into adulthood somewhat easier.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are things you can only truly understand and learn from after experiencing them. If too much time has passed, it's hard to remember, which is why freshmen like us, with almost vivid memories of the intense high school exam preparation and the new experiences of gap years or university life, hope that our insights and advice will be useful and practical for our Gen Z generation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, remember that your journey and perspective will not completely align with ours. So, be discerning, and selective in what you take from our shares to learn and grow from. We sincerely hope you can draw something from this to avoid our mistakes or help your upcoming journey progress faster! Thank you for coming and following our posts. Don't hesitate to connect and share interesting and fun things with us!
