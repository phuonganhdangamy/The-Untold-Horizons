            The summer break is here, but it feels quite different for the 2k6 students this year. This time, it's not just a school or city-wide exam like the transition from middle to high school. You're competing with students nationwide in the university entrance exam season. I understand the immense pressure and stress you’re under, as I’ve faced many exams and the challenge of university entrance exams myself. You’re probably most concerned about how to study more effectively. Today, I’ll share some small tips to help you stay alert and relaxed, making your study sessions more productive.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h1> 1. Notifications from your phone—record a timelapse </h1>
            <br>
            Living in the information age, also known as the age of distraction, our phones are the main culprits of our inattentiveness and sluggishness in studying. However, if used wisely, especially during this stressful exam season, they can also be motivational tools. Instead of just silencing notifications or handing your phone over to your parents, why not try something new? Have you seen those "quick study clips" on TikTok or the "pomodoro study with me" videos? Here’s a tip: after silencing your notifications, place your phone on your desk or somewhere to record your study session. Later, use an app like Capcut to speed up the footage and add a study template. You’ll have a motivating study clip where you’re the star! From my experience, this method helps maintain focus, as no one wants to be seen slacking off in a recording. Plus, you’ll have footage to look back on, reminding you of your dedication.

            <br>
        <h1> 2. Listen to your body </h1>
            <br>
            When preparing for exams, we often think we must stay up all night and study around the clock. However, this is not advisable. Health is crucial for achieving long-term goals, so it’s essential to listen to your body. Have you ever been in class, fully attentive, yet couldn’t grasp the lesson no matter how many times it was repeated? Or felt frustrated while solving a problem, rereading the explanation multiple times without understanding? I have. Sometimes, a short 5-10 minute walk can clear your mind, and when you return, everything clicks into place. This happens because your brain needed a break after hours of intense work. Instead of getting frustrated, listen to your body and take a break. In the afternoon, consider running for 30-40 minutes to feel refreshed and ready to study.
            <br>
            Staying up all night frequently has adverse effects on your health. Studies show it can lead to mood disorders, impaired cognition, and other health risks like obesity and high blood pressure. If you naturally thrive at night, you might benefit from it, but for most of us who grew up sleeping 9 hours a night, it’s tough to adapt. When I entered high school, I was overwhelmed by my peers' excellence and pressured myself into sleeping only 4-5 hours a night, affecting my focus and performance. In 11th and 12th grade, I switched to waking up early to study instead of staying up late. I would study until 9:30 PM, then sleep and wake up at 3:45 or 3:30 AM. I recommend using a minty toothpaste to help wake up and saffron for those who struggle with sleep and anxiety.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h1>3. Stay hydrated with WATER</h1>
            <br>
        <h2>DRINK WATER —> Boost creativity and focus:</h2>
            Everyone knows that water makes up over 60% of our body, so we must drink enough to keep our bodies functioning. Besides benefits like detoxification and skin health, water also enhances brain focus. Research shows that dehydration can shrink brain cells, impairing their efficiency. So, always keep a bottle of water nearby while studying and aim for 2 liters daily. If you exercise a lot, increase this to 2.5-3 liters. Start your day with a glass of warm water, which stimulates your organs to work properly.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h2>TAKE A COLD SHOWER, ICE PACK ON THE NECK —> Stimulate nerves and feel refreshed:</h2>
            "Cold showers have been proven to improve blood circulation. They can lower blood pressure, increase endorphins (feel-good hormones), and reduce cortisol (a stress hormone).” So, take a cold shower at 6 AM and in the afternoon to soothe your mind and enhance your studying efficiency. Note: Avoid showering after 10 PM!
            <br>
            At other times, try placing an ice pack or cold towel on the back of your neck for 1-3 minutes. This can improve your mood and reduce stress, similar to a cold shower. In traditional medicine, the nape of the neck has a pressure point called "Feng Fu," and applying cold to this point can improve mood and reduce anxiety.

        <h1>MY TYPICAL STUDY DAY DURING UNIVERSITY PREP</h1>
            A few notes before you read: I studied for the A1 combination (Math, Physics, English) and also Chemistry, so my day revolved around these four subjects. You can adjust this plan to fit your subjects.
            <br>
            <br>
            3:30-3:45 AM: Wake up, brush teeth, wash face, and drink a refreshing glass of water.
            <br>
            3:50-5:45 AM: Study English vocabulary and grammar using the Pomodoro technique (50 minutes studying, 10 minutes break). Use a laptop, iPad, or phone to play "study with me" videos.
            <br>
            5:45-5:55 AM: Take a short walk outside to relax.
            <br>
            6:05-6:30 AM: Have breakfast and list the tasks for the day (e.g., how many math problems, English exercises, and physics/chemistry topics to cover).
            <br>
            6:30-6:55 AM: Take a shower and set up the study area with pens, notebooks, water bottle, and phone to record.
            <br>    
            7:00-9:10 AM: Do a math practice test for 80-85 minutes to simulate exam conditions, then review and analyze mistakes.
            <br>
            Note: Don't for get to give yourself a short break to stretch, drink water, and walk around after finishing the practice test, but refrain from touching your phone!
            <br>
            9:15-11:00 AM: Complete an English practice test, check answers, and write down new vocabulary and grammar.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lunch break: Have lunch and take a 45-minute nap. After waking up at 12:15 PM, wash your face, use an ice pack on the neck, set up the study area, and start studying by 12:30 PM.
            <br>
            12:30-12:50 PM: Continue reviewing English vocabulary and grammar or go over new concepts.
            <br>
            12:55-2:40 PM: Complete a physics practice test and review mistakes.
            <br>
            2:45-4:25 PM: Finish another physics practice test and review.
            <br>
            <br>
            Afternoon break: Take a 40-minute run, shower, have dinner, and prepare for evening study sessions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Evenings are usually reserved for extra classes or tutoring. If not attending extra classes, use this time to incorporate other subjects.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope these tips help improve your study mindset. Wishing you all good health and success in your studies. May each stroke of your pen bring you closer to your dreams.
