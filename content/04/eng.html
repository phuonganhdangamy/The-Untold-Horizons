                    Have you ever had this feeling: You try hard and study diligently throughout the school year, and it feels like this is the toughest year yet with mountains of homework, deadlines, strict teachers, and so on? You think it's only a matter of time before you give up because no matter how much you study, it never seems to end, and you feel utterly discouraged…
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    But then: Once again, you complete the school year excellently. Looking back at the journey, you wonder how those nine months of school passed so quickly and smoothly. The negative feelings and pressures during the struggle suddenly disappear…
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    What happened? Why do we look at the same challenge with different attitudes at different stages?

                    This feeling has happened to me almost every year since I became aware of the challenges and the need to face difficulties to grow. I’m unsure how others feel, or if they notice this pattern like I do. Here are my thoughts on explaining this change in mindset and perspective. I’ll try to update you with scientific findings if I find any reliable sources, but for now, these are mostly my subjective views!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <b>Before the challenge:</b> “I am still in my comfort zone. I feel comfortable, relaxed, and familiar with everything happening around me. I may feel dissatisfied with myself, feel bored, unproductive, or not, but overall, everything is under control.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <b>During the challenge:</b> “I meet unfamiliar factors outside my comfort zone. Stepping out of my zone, I feel strange, off-balance, and somewhat overwhelmed by what's coming. If my comfort zone is like a lone house in the deep forest, stepping out of my comfort zone is like leaving the house for the first time to get food or wood, venturing into the dark, dangerous forest, fearing unknown traps or dangerous creatures. In that situation, how could one not be scared? The forest is full of dangers and even creatures I may not have known. I may make more mistakes because I’m not familiar with the terrain. Everything becomes exponentially harder because the path ahead seems dark and scary, but standing still is not an option either as it makes me easy prey for wild beasts. I must learn while walking to understand the forest better and move closer to the goal. I switch to try-hard mode, struggling to find coping and survival mechanisms in this unfamiliar place. Time keeps passing, so compared to being at home, I exhaust more energy, especially mentally, to push myself to complete tasks on time.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <b>After the challenge:</b> With so much effort and determination, I successfully bring “wood and food” back home! Not only do I have food to eat and wood stay warm, but I also bring back various materials and survival experience in that forest. Therefore, I can expand my land and build a bigger house. My comfort zone is extended from what I gathered throughout the challenge. I have more and live more comfortably. Looking back, I feel somewhat confident knowing where the poisonous mushrooms and dangerous beasts are, and which paths are safe. Perhaps things will change, but at least I had the experience, knew the way, and conquered it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    A school year or a challenge at our age is of course not as exaggeratedly scary as the story of the house in the deep forest above, not to mention that we usually have support from friends and family and don’t have to fight alone like in the example. But undeniably, no matter how big or small the challenge is, it has helped us step out of our comfort zone and grow. The more our comfort zone expands, the greater our potential. The more we experience, the stronger our mentality becomes. How we overcome challenges, whether successful or not, depends on each person's mentality and attitude when facing difficulties. But once we get through it, we realize it’s not as scary and hard as we thought.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Challenges are a part of life. Without them, we might not push ourselves out of our comfort zone. Climbing uphill is tiring, but reaching the top means conquering a new peak. So, if you’re still struggling with something, keep believing and persevering, because often the destination is just a few steps away!
