                    Amid the hustle and bustle of life, with its countless worries and responsibilities, each of us harbors personal fears that we may not always be able to share with anyone. You know, some concerns, if left unresolved or unshared with friends and family, can eventually affect our mental well-being. There are times when we may feel down or doubt ourselves after a setback or failure, and over time, we start telling ourselves things like, "You’ll never be able to do this" or "You’re really terrible, nobody cares about you." I've felt that way too. Let me share how I’ve dealt with these daunting thoughts and how I overcame them.

                    As I mentioned in my previous post, I am a student at Tran Chuyen, and as you might expect, the students here impress me with their ability to absorb knowledge. Because of this, I often felt inferior and asked myself, "Why does everyone else understand everything while I still don’t get it?" "Why is everyone good except me? Am I really that bad? 😔" Not to mention how others in my class aced the IELTS with scores like 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, while I could only manage a 6.5 😥. I’m a specialized student, yet I failed the city-level competition in my major, while others, who weren’t even majoring in Math, managed to win prizes... Why does everyone have such strong profiles while I don’t even know how to write an essay? What even is a Personal Statement? We’re all the same age, so why am I so inferior? At that time, I truly believed that I was terribly inadequate, and it made me very sad. This was the root of my fear of low grades, failure, and being judged as not good enough. I cried almost every night… feeling so helpless… Yet, by day, I would still smile, stay cheerful, and spread positive energy without sharing these feelings with anyone, like I had a split personality😀. That’s how it was… But eventually, I managed to overcome those mental barriers. In the end, I achieved my goals, fulfilled my long-held aspirations, and gradually became a better version of myself. So, what was my secret?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Actually, there wasn’t anything special… I just happened to listen to some healing podcasts and read books, which made me realize that “If I change my perspective on the problem, things will significantly improve.” When I encountered an issue, I started adding the phrase “at least” to my thoughts. For example, “Why do others score 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 on IELTS while I only got a 6.5?” —> No! At least I know I need to try harder, so that will be my goal, to improve and better myself. At least I put in serious effort during those past months, and with just a little more time, things will get better. “It seems like I’m the only one in class who doesn’t get it because everyone else does” —> No! At least I can ask them questions, learn more from them because I’m studying with them, not on my own. At least I recognize that I haven’t fully grasped the material, so I need to invest more time rather than just skimming through it. At least this way, I can understand how others think and approach the material. Try turning your stress into motivation and a sense of calmness, and you’ll see a significant positive change in yourself. In the end, it’s only us who can actively make a difference.

                    While writing this, I was worried that I might come across as cliché and unhelpful, but I believe that at the very least, you’ll understand how changing your perspective can make you want to study and improve yourself on the journey ahead. I hope that, like me, you will become more resilient in the face of adversity, weathering each storm to eventually embrace the long days of clear skies and sunshine that lie ahead. Keep going! Try changing your perspective, and everything will look different! Between good and bad, positive and negative, why do we keep clinging to the bad and negative? Instead, let’s see them as a battle horse that stands by our side, always giving us the strength to overcome the army of difficulties.
